		<h1>deadpine â€” product and brand designer</h1>
		<p>
      For 10 years my journey has intertwined product design and brand identity with technology, mostly in crypto. With Bitcoin and Ethereum I discovered an opportunity to work fostering an open economic system based on freedom and responsibility. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've collaborated with projects like OpenZeppelin, Flashbots, ETHLatam, Decentraland, Forta, Exactly, Rewilder and Ethernaut DAO
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy bringing my designs to life through coding. I have experience in frontend development, including HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not everything is about technology. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am interested in anthropology, biology, behavioral science, color theory, architecture, scenography, and pottery. I'm part of the Fuego Austral community, bringing art to life and cultivating meaningful offline connections.
