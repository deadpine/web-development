		<h1>deadpine â€” product and brand designer</h1>
		<p>
      For 10 years my journey has intertwined product design and brand identity with technology, mostly in crypto. With Bitcoin and Ethereum I discovered an opportunity to work fostering an open economic system based on freedom and responsibility. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've collaborated with projects like 
      <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/" target="_blank">OpenZeppelin</a>, 
      <a href="https://flashbots.net/" target="_blank">Flashbots</a>, 
      <a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank">Decentraland</a>, 
      <a href="http://ethlatam.org/" target="_blank">ETHLatam</a>, 
      <a href="https://forta.org/" target="_blank">Forta</a>, 
      <a href="https://app.exact.ly/" target="_blank">Exactly</a>, 
      <a href="https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about" target="_blank">Ethernaut DAO</a>, 
      and 
      <a href="https://app.rewilder.xyz/donation/27" target="_blank">Rewilder</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy bringing my designs to life through coding. I have experience in frontend development, including HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not everything is about technology. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am interested in anthropology, biology, behavioral science, color theory, architecture, scenography, and pottery. I'm part of the <a href="https://fuegoaustral.org/" target="_blank">Fuego Austral</a> community, bringing art to life and cultivating meaningful offline connections.
